MyLinkedList is an implementation of the linked list which supports and provides
basic list operations. The class extends MyAbstractList. The class includes methods
for list operations such as getting, setting, and removing elements
at specific indexes, as well as finding the index of a particular element.
The class also supports adding elements to the beginning or end of the list,
removing elements from the beginning or end, and reversing the order of elements.
